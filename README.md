# AES256

This was written in the course Cryptography.
The task was to implement a AES256 algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. This was a 6-part lab with this code being the final product.

This script also contains tests which can be run in test explorer.


I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)

### Run the script

```python
$ python main.py
```
